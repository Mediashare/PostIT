# Welcome to Mediashare

>   Mediashare is an entity used to **share resources on the internet**.  
On this site you will find mainly **code and documentation** about the different libraries created. **Open-sourcing and knowledge** sharing is in Mediashare's DNA.  
It is obvious that knowledge is empirical, especially in the field of the web, that's why Mediashare exists and why we **promote code sharing** in order to **make more accessible all the information available** on the internet.
